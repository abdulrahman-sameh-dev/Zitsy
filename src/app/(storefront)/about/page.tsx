        Zitsy sells T-shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, tote bags, mugs, stickers and
        more. Every design is made to order: you place an order, the item is
        printed and shipped to you across the United Kingdom or Germany.
      </p>
      <h2>How ordering works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Pick a product and choose the real colour, size and options shown on
          its page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check out securely with PayPal. Prices are shown in GBP — the price
          you see for your chosen variant is the price you pay.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your item is made to order, then packed and shipped by our
          production partners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow it from your order confirmation: you can track any order by
          order number and email — no account needed — or open the carrier link
          from your tracking email.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Why made to order</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing sits in a warehouse waiting for a buyer, and nothing is printed
        until it has an owner. That is kinder to surplus stock, frees us to
        offer a wider range of products, and keeps pricing simple.
