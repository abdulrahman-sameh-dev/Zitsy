# Zitsy — Architecture Plan (Phase 0)

Tagline: **Easy as Zitsy.**
Goal: the smallest reliable production system that can sell real products via Printify fulfillment + PayPal payments.

## 1. Critical flow

```
Printify API ──sync/webhooks──▶ PostgreSQL (local catalog = storefront read model)
                                         │
Customer → Shop → Product → Variant → Cart → Checkout
                                         │
                              server-side validation (variant, price, country)
                                         │
                              Order(PAYMENT_PENDING) + Payment(PENDING)
                                         │
                              PayPal order created (server)
                                         │
                              capture + server-side verification
                                         │
                              Payment COMPLETED → Order PAID   (exactly once)
                                         │
                              Printify order created (exactly once, external_id = order id)
                                         │
                              Printify fulfillment webhooks → IN_PRODUCTION → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
                                         │
                              Resend transactional email (best-effort, never blocks state)
```

PostgreSQL is the source of truth. Email/webhook delivery never corrupts order state.

## 2. Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + small shadcn-style `components/ui` primitives |
| DB | PostgreSQL (local: `zitsy_store`, test: `zitsy_store_test`) + Prisma 7 (migrations only) |
| Validation | Zod 4 |
| Payments | PayPal Orders v2 REST (sandbox), server-side capture + webhook verification |
| Fulfillment | Printify Public API v1 (Bearer token, server-only) |
| Email | Resend (official `resend` SDK, `Idempotency-Key` per send) + React Email HTML templates rendered with `@react-email/render` |
| Auth | Custom minimal email+password (scrypt) + DB session cookie — no external auth provider |
| Money | Integer minor units (`*Minor` columns), `STORE_CURRENCY=GBP` |
| Tests | Vitest (unit + DB integration, mocked transports), Playwright (browser E2E on the test DB + a local Resend HTTP stub) |

```

Responsibility rules:
- `lib/printify`, `lib/paypal`, `lib/email` — external I/O only, never business rules.
- `services/checkout` — the only place that may create orders/payments/fulfillment.
- State machines are pure functions (`lib/orders/state-machine.ts`, `lib/payments/state-machine.ts`).
- No `process.env` reads outside `lib/config/env.ts`.

## 4. Data model (Prisma)

- **User** email unique, passwordHash, name.
- **Session** tokenHash unique, userId, expiresAt (cookie holds raw token).
- **Product** printifyId unique, slug unique, title, description, tags[], options Json (definitions from Printify), visible, blueprintId, printProviderId, minPriceMinor, currency, syncedAt.
- **ProductImage** productId+src unique, position, isDefault, variantIds Int[].
- **ProductVariant** (productId, printifyVariantId) unique, priceMinor, isEnabled, isAvailable, colorName?, sizeName?, optionValueIds Int[], options Json, sku, title.
- **Category** slug unique + **ProductCategory** join — derived from real Printify tags through one normalization layer.
- **Cart** token unique, userId? — **CartItem** (cartId, variantId) unique, quantity, unitPriceMinor snapshot.
- **Order** orderNumber unique, userId?, email, status, currency, subtotal/shipping/total Minor, shipping address, paypalOrderId unique?, printifyOrderId?, **trackingToken unique?** (24 random bytes, base64url — the public `/track-order/<token>` link), **deliveredAt?**, timestamps.
- **OrderItem** snapshot: printifyProductId, printifyVariantId, title, variantTitle, qty, unit/total price.
- **Payment** provider, providerOrderId, status, amountMinor, unique(orderId, provider).
- **WebhookEvent** (provider, eventId) unique — idempotency ledger for webhook dedupe.
- **CatalogSyncRun** type/status/counters — sync + reconciliation visibility.
- **EmailLog** kind/status/error/**dedupeKey unique?** — the idempotency ledger: one accepted send per key (`order-confirmed|order-submitted|order-shipped|order-delivered|admin-new-order:<orderId>`, `support-message|support-received:<uuid>`), mirrored to Resend's `Idempotency-Key` header. Proves email attempts without affecting order state.

Constraints: unique business keys on Printify IDs (no duplicates on retry), FK cascade on cart items/images/variants, numeric checks (>=0) on money columns.

## 5. State machines

Order (payment lifecycle): `PENDING → PAYMENT_PENDING → PAID`, plus `PAYMENT_FAILED`, `CANCELLED`. Once `PAID`, it stays `PAID` (see Phase 6).
Fulfillment (separate `FulfillmentStatus` on `Order`): `PENDING → SUBMITTED → ON_HOLD | SENDING_TO_PRODUCTION → IN_PRODUCTION → PARTIALLY_FULFILLED → FULFILLED`, plus `CANCELLED`, `ACTION_REQUIRED`, `UNFULFILLABLE`. Fulfillment changes are forward-only (an older Printify event can never regress `FULFILLED → IN_PRODUCTION`), and no fulfillment failure ever changes payment state.

Payment: `PENDING → COMPLETED | FAILED | CANCELLED`.
Order is marked PAID only from server-side PayPal capture/verification (never from browser redirect).

## 6. Checkout & idempotency

1. Server loads cart by cookie and re-validates every variant (exists, belongs to product, visible, enabled, available, quantity ≤ 99) and recomputes totals from DB prices. MVP sets shipping = 0 (no shipping/tax engine yet, documented — never fabricated).
2. Creates Order (PAYMENT_PENDING) with an immutable snapshot of every line (Printify ids, title, variant title, sku, quantity, unit price, line total, currency) + Payment (PENDING) — in one transaction. A unique retry loop allocates the order number.
3. Creates the PayPal order (`intent=CAPTURE`, `purchase_units[0].custom_id` and `reference_id` = our order id, `amount.value` = `toDecimalString(totalMinor)`), stores `paypalOrderId`.
4. Browser approves via the PayPal JS SDK; `onApprove` calls the server action `captureCheckoutAction`.
5. Server captures with `PayPal-Request-Id: zitsy-capture-<orderId>` (idempotent). On `422 ORDER_ALREADY_CAPTURED` it fetches the existing order via `getOrder` instead of charging again.
6. It verifies the authoritative response: purchase-unit custom/reference id matches our order, capture `status === COMPLETED`, currency matches, and `amount.value` equals `toDecimalString(order.totalMinor)`.
7. Transaction: Payment → COMPLETED (guard: only if currently PENDING), Order → PAID (guard: only from PAYMENT_PENDING), then delete the cart's items by `Order.cartId`. A second caller fails the guard and exits cleanly.
8. A mismatch (amount/currency/reference) records Payment FAILED + Order PAYMENT_FAILED and never marks paid. A transient failure leaves the order payable for retry.

PayPal webhooks (`POST /v1/notifications/verify-webhook-signature`, deduped via `WebhookEvent @@unique([provider,eventId])`) drive the same idempotent path: `CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED` triggers the server capture, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED` verifies + marks paid, `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED` fails the payment. Refresh/retry/duplicate delivery all converge on one PAID state. **Browser is never the source of truth** — the order only becomes PAID after server-side capture/verification.

Shipping/tax is intentionally out of scope for Phase 5 (shipping is exactly zero). Fulfillment/Printify order creation is Phase 6 (see below); emails are Phase 8.

## 7. Catalog synchronization

- **Full sync** (`pnpm printify:sync`): paginated `GET /v1/shops/{id}/products.json`, upsert by `printifyId` in a transaction, replace images/variants, rebuild category links, mark unseen products as hidden. Also ensures webhook subscriptions exist.
- **Webhooks**: `product:created|updated|deleted` — payload only carries `shop_id`, so handler refetches the product by id and upserts (safe on retry). `order:*` events update fulfillment state.
- **Reconciliation**: the same full-sync path; idempotent by design, so it can run any time.
- Options/colors/sizes: rendered exclusively from `product.options` × enabled+available variants. Nothing is hardcoded; a variant combination only appears if a purchasable variant exists with that option-value set.

## 8. Markets & currency

`src/lib/markets.ts`: `{ GB, DE }`, `STORE_CURRENCY=GBP`, no FX. Checkout rejects any other country. Printify variant prices are already integer minor units in the shop currency; we assume the Printify shop currency equals `STORE_CURRENCY` (documented assumption).

## 9. Security

- Secrets only via `lib/config/env.ts`; no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for anything secret (`NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` only — client IDs are public by design).
- Webhook endpoints verify signatures (PayPal verify-webhook-signature API; Printify `X-Pfy-Signature: sha256=HMAC-SHA256(rawBody, PRINTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET)` with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`).
- Zod on every API/action input; server is authoritative for prices, variants, country, totals.
- Authorization: there is no account/login surface yet (guest checkout only), so nothing is scoped to a session user; checkout capture/success is scoped to the HMAC-signed `zitsy_order` cookie — the success page reads the order from that cookie only, never from a query parameter (browser can never declare an order paid; only server capture/webhook after amount+currency+reference verification).
- Response headers (`next.config.ts`): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`, `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`, `X-Powered-By` removed. `/checkout/success` and `/track-order/*` additionally send `Cache-Control: private, no-store`. No CSP by design — it would have to allow the PayPal JS SDK and Printify-hosted imagery.
- JSON-LD on the product page is emitted through `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with `<` escaped to `<`, so a catalog string containing `</script>` or `<!--` cannot break out of the `<script type="application/ld+json">` element.
- Prisma parameterized queries; no secrets in logs; `.env` gitignored.
- **Order tracking** is login-free and capability-based: the URL token is 192 bits of randomness (`randomBytes(24)` → base64url), never derived from the order number/id; reading a tracking page reveals order status, items and tracking only. The number+email lookup and the token page are rate limited per IP (10/min), and lookup failures always return the same generic message (`We couldn't find an order matching those details…`) so orders cannot be enumerated.
- **Contact form** is validated with Zod, protected by a `website` honeypot and a per-IP limit (5 messages / 10 min), and only ever delivers to `SUPPORT_EMAIL`.
- **Email never carries authority or secrets.** Sends are best-effort: failure is recorded in `EmailLog` and logged (recipient masked) but never rolls back a payment, fails a PAID order or cancels a Printify order, and provider errors are never shown to customers. `RESEND_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `PRINTIFY_*` and PayPal secrets are never rendered into an email or a response.

## 10. Environment variables (canonical, no aliases)

Required: `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `STORE_CURRENCY`.
Integration (degrade safely when absent): `AUTH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_TAGLINE`, `PRINTIFY_*` (5), `PAYPAL_*` (4) + `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `SUPPORT_EMAIL`, `CRON_SECRET` (Vercel Cron bearer — unset ⇒ both `/api/cron/*` respond 503, fail closed).
Email: `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` (e.g. `Zitsy <orders@yourdomain.com>`, a domain verified in Resend) enable customer/admin notifications; `SUPPORT_EMAIL` is the store inbox that receives admin notifications and contact-form messages (separate from the customer-facing `EMAIL_FROM`); `RESEND_API_URL` is a **test-only** override of the Resend API base URL that points the SDK at a local stub — leave it unset in production.
Deployment: the checked-in `.env` is a local development configuration. A production deployment must set real values — Postgres `DATABASE_URL`, a production `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=production`, `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` / `PRINTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` paired in the provider dashboards, `CRON_SECRET`, a verified-domain `EMAIL_FROM`/`SUPPORT_EMAIL`, and a non-localhost `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (a production build refuses to proceed with a localhost URL by design, and `emailConfig()` refuses to send when `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is localhost).
Checkout/PayPal buttons disable cleanly when PayPal is not configured; catalog pages serve the local DB regardless.

## 11. Phase gates

Phase 1 foundation boots (app + DB + env validation) → Phase 2 real catalog sync verified → Phase 3 storefront with correct variant resolution → Phase 4 cart/orders → Phase 5 PayPal verified → Phase 6 fulfillment → Phase 7 commerce (pricing/FX/shipping) → Phase 8 email/tracking/support → Phase 9 auth/account → Phase 10 polish → Phase 11 verification. If a gate fails (DB down, sync wrong, variant resolution wrong, payment verification weak), stop before the next phase.

## 12. Progress log

### Phase 1 — Foundation (DONE)
- Prisma 7 setup verified: `prisma.config.ts` (datasource + migrations), generator `prisma-client` → `src/generated/prisma`, `PrismaPg` driver adapter in `src/lib/db/prisma.ts`, migration `20261006204811_init` applied to `zitsy_store` (16 tables).
- Gotchas resolved: `url` removed from `datasource` block (moved to config); `Payment.orderId` made `@unique` for the 1:1 with `Order`; back-relations added for `ProductVariant`; `server-only` package replaced with an explicit `typeof window` guard in `env.ts` because it throws under plain Node/tsx scripts.
- Base UI: `globals.css` (green brand scale + semantic canvas/ink/muted/line tokens, focus-visible, `container-page`), Geist fonts, root layout metadata, `not-found`/`error`/`global-error`/`loading` boundaries.
- `src/lib/log.ts` (sanitising structured logger), `src/lib/money.ts` (minor-unit money formatting), `src/lib/utils.ts` (`cn`).
- Gate: `next dev` returns 200, 404 page works, `tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Phase 2 — Printify client, catalog sync, webhooks (DONE)
- `src/lib/printify/types.ts` — typed subset aligned to the saved OpenAPI (product option values are `int` value ids; `variants[].price` is integer minor units; list response is a Laravel-style paginated envelope with `next_page_url`).
- `src/lib/printify/client.ts` — fetch wrapper (Bearer, UA, timeout, `PrintifyApiError`), `listProducts`/`getAllProducts` (page walk), `getProduct`, `getShippingCosts`, `createOrder`, `getOrder`, `sendToProduction`, webhook CRUD, `getPrintifyClient()` factory.
- `src/lib/printify/webhooks.ts` — HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (`X-Pfy-Signature: sha256=…`, `timingSafeEqual`), `PRINTIFY_WEBHOOK_TOPICS`, `ensurePrintifyWebhooks` reconciliation.
- `src/lib/catalog/slug.ts` — `toSlug`/`uniqueSlug`, variant display title + color/size extraction from product options.
- `src/lib/catalog/sync.ts` — `upsertProductFromApi` (atomic per-product replace of images; variants upserted by `(productId, printifyVariantId)` so their cuid is stable across syncs, and variants removed from Printify are disabled rather than deleted so cart/order references stay valid — idempotent), `syncCatalog` (paginated fetch, upsert all, hide products absent from Printify instead of deleting, `CatalogSyncRun` record with status/counts/error).
- `src/lib/printify/handlers.ts` — `processPrintifyWebhook`: dedupe via `WebhookEvent @@unique([provider,eventId])`, product:created/updated/deleted applied (deleted hides), order events marked `deferred` (forward-only until Phase 6).
- `src/app/api/webhooks/printify/route.ts` — POST only; 503 when unconfigured, 401 bad signature, 400 bad JSON, 500 on processing failure (Printify retries), 200 on success.
- `scripts/printify-sync.ts` (`pnpm printify:sync`) — webhook reconciliation + full sync CLI.
- Tests: `tests/webhooks.test.ts` (signature), `tests/printify-client.test.ts` (auth header, pagination, error mapping, order POST), `tests/catalog-sync.test.ts` (real sync against `zitsy_store_test` DB: full upsert, hide-removed, idempotency, webhook processing/deferral, dedupe). Vitest config: `globalSetup` runs `prisma migrate deploy` on the test DB, `setupFiles` redirects `DATABASE_URL` before `env.ts` loads.
- Gate: 16/16 tests pass, `tsc --noEmit` + `eslint` clean, dev server: home 200, webhook 503 (unconfigured in dev) / 405 on GET.

### Phase 3 — Storefront (DONE)
- Catalog read path: `src/lib/catalog/categories.ts` (deterministic category derivation from real tags with explicit keyword rules; Tote Bags won over generic Bags; fallback to first real tag), `src/lib/catalog/view.ts` (`buildProductView` → serializable view; `imagesForVariant`), `src/lib/catalog/query.ts` (visible-only summaries, product view by slug, category filter, featured = cheapest per category, sitemap entries).
- Storefront UI in route group `src/app/(storefront)/`: `layout.tsx` (header/footer + `#main-content`), `page.tsx` (hero + Suspense-streamed featured/category sections), `shop/page.tsx` (`?category=` filter, empty state), `shop/loading.tsx` (skeleton), `product/[slug]/page.tsx` (breadcrumb, description, tags, JSON-LD), `cart/page.tsx` (honest empty placeholder). Components: `header`, `footer`, `product-card`, `product-grid-skeleton`, and the client `product-view` (real per-product option dimensions, availability-aware chips, exact variant resolution, variant price, variant-filtered gallery + lightbox, quantity, add-to-cart placeholder disabled until a full selection exists).
- Next 16 findings: `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` is ignored in this version — use `await connection()` from `next/server` for request-time catalog reads; `PageProps`/`LayoutProps` globals require generated `.next/types`, so prop types are declared inline so `pnpm typecheck` works standalone; a route-group `loading.tsx` (or root `loading.tsx`) creates a Suspense boundary that flushes before `notFound()`, making the product 404 return HTTP 200 — loading was scoped to `/shop` and home streams via explicit `<Suspense>` instead.
- SEO: per-product `generateMetadata` + canonical + OpenGraph, `app/robots.ts`, dynamic `app/sitemap.ts` (static pages + all visible products).
- Real-catalog verification (prod build against `zitsy_store`): home/shop/product/cart 200; `/product/<unknown>` and unknown paths 404; legends match exact Printify option names (`Scents, Size`, `Colors, Sizes`, `Bag Size`, `Clothing sizes + Gildan Colors`) — no Color/Size assumption; GBP prices (mug £8.38, candle £22.58); JSON-LD Offer `price/currency/availability` from the minimum variant price.
- Tests (48 total, all passing): `tests/variants.test.ts` (option dims, availability, exact resolution, pricing), `tests/categories.test.ts`, `tests/images.test.ts`, `tests/catalog-view.test.ts` (integration on `zitsy_store_test`). `tsc --noEmit` + `eslint` clean; production `next build` clean.
- Not in scope (deliberately deferred): cart persistence/checkout/orders/email/auth/admin. Add-to-cart is a disabled-until-valid UI placeholder.
- Note: a local production build requires a non-localhost `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (by design); Phase 3 build verified with `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://zitsy.example`.

### Phase 4 — Cart (DONE)
- **Sync identity fix (prerequisite).** `upsertProductFromApi` previously did `ProductVariant.deleteMany` + `createMany` per product, which changed every variant cuid on every sync; with `CartItem.variantId onDelete: Cascade` that silently wiped carts on every sync (and would break `OrderItem.variantId onDelete: Restrict` once orders exist). Variants are now **upserted by `(productId, printifyVariantId)`** (cuid stays stable) and variants absent from the incoming payload are **disabled, not deleted**. Verified by `tests/cart-resilience.test.ts` (variant cuid + cart line survive two resyncs, including a variant that disappears) and by a live `pnpm printify:sync` (20/20 upserted, 0 errors, variant cuid unchanged, cart item intact).
- Cart modules: `src/lib/cart/errors.ts` (`CartError` with safe user messages), `schemas.ts` (Zod: `addItemSchema {productId, variantId, quantity 1..99}`, `updateItemSchema`, `removeItemSchema`; `MAX_ITEM_QUANTITY=99`, `MAX_CART_LINES=50`), `session.ts` (guest cookie `zitsy_cart`; only `sha256(token)` is stored in `Cart.token`, raw random 32-byte base64url stays httpOnly/sameSite=lax/secure-in-prod/~30d), `service.ts` (`getOrCreateCartByTokenHash`, `getCartByTokenHash`, `addItem`, `updateItem`, `removeItem`, `clearCart` — all scoped by `cartId`), `view.ts` (pure `buildCartView`: current server price, `recordedPriceMinor` snapshot, `priceChanged`, per-line `available`/`unavailableReason`, subtotal over available lines only, `totalQuantity`, `hasUnavailable`, `canCheckout`), `read.ts` (`loadCartView`/`loadCartCount`, never creates a cart), `actions.ts` (`"use server"` add/update/remove/clear with Zod parse + `revalidatePath("/", "layout")`).
- Server authority: the client sends only `{ productId, variantId, quantity }`; the server re-loads the variant and rejects unknown, mismatched-product, hidden-product, disabled or unavailable variants, and stores the DB price/currency (never a client price). Ownership is by cookie only (no client cart id); every mutation is scoped by `cartId`, so cross-cart updates/removes fail with `item_not_found`.
- UI: `header.tsx` is now async and shows a real cart badge from `loadCartCount()`; `product-view.tsx` submits the real `addToCart` server action (disabled until a complete valid selection exists) with pending/success/error states; `cart/page.tsx` renders the client `cart-view.tsx` (lines, images, quantity steppers, remove, clear, per-line "price changed" and unavailable reasons, subtotal over available lines, checkout CTA). New `/checkout` placeholder (no payment yet).
- Resync resilience: variants that vanish from Printify are disabled → existing cart lines survive and render as "unavailable — remove to continue", and `canCheckout` stays false.
- Tests (71 total, all passing; +23 for cart): `tests/cart-view.test.ts` (pure projection: current price vs snapshot, price-change flags, unavailable reasons, subtotal only over available lines, checkout gating), `tests/cart-service.test.ts` (integration on `zitsy_store_test`: unknown/other-product/hidden/disabled/unavailable variant rejection, server-stored price, duplicate-add merge, quantity cap, distinct lines, update/remove/clear, cross-cart ownership isolation, no-cart-on-read, stale availability, price increase), `tests/cart-resilience.test.ts` (real sync keeps variant cuid + cart line, and dropped variant survives as unavailable).
- Real-catalog verification (prod build against `zitsy_store`): `/`, `/shop`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, product page, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` all 200; unknown product 404; with a real cart cookie the header shows `Cart, 2 items` and `/cart` shows the line, `2 items`, a `Price changed from £0.00 to £4.99` notice, and subtotal `£9.98` (2 × £4.99 current price); with no cookie `/cart` shows the empty state; a different cookie sees an empty cart. Live `pnpm printify:sync` then re-rendered the same cart with the variant cuid unchanged. `tsc --noEmit` + `eslint` clean; production `next build` clean.
- Note: the async `Header` reads the cart cookie, so storefront routes render dynamically (expected for a live cart badge).

### Phase 5 — Checkout & PayPal (DONE)
- **Schema.** `Order.cartId String?` added (scalar, no FK) so the webhook path can idempotently clear the cart even when the browser is gone; migration `20261006225626_add_order_cart_id`. Order ownership on the success page is a stateless HMAC-signed httpOnly cookie `zitsy_order` (`createOrderRef`/`verifyOrderRef`, signed with `AUTH_SECRET`, ~3h) — no extra schema field.
- `src/lib/paypal/config.ts` — `PAYPAL_PROVIDER`, sandbox/live base URLs, `paypalBaseUrl`, `isPaypalConfigured`, `isPaypalWebhookConfigured`. `types.ts` — `PaypalGateway` interface + order/capture/webhook types. `client.ts` — `PayPalClient` (cached OAuth2 client-credentials grant, `createOrder`, `captureOrder(id, requestId)`, `getOrder`, `verifyWebhookSignature`, `PayPalApiError` with `status`/`paypalName`/`body`, timeout) + `getPayPalClient()`.
- `src/lib/orders/state.ts` (explicit forward-only `ORDER_TRANSITIONS`/`PAYMENT_TRANSITIONS`, `canTransition*`, `isPayableOrderStatus`, `isPaidOrderStatus`) and `orders/order-number.ts` (`ZS-XXXXXXXX`).
- `src/lib/checkout/errors.ts` (`CheckoutError` with safe user messages), `schemas.ts` (Zod `customerSchema`: trimmed, lowercased email, uppercased `GB|DE` country, optional empty→undefined), `session.ts` (signed order cookie), `service.ts` (`prepareCheckout` — server revalidation/snapshot; `beginCheckout` — reuse a matching PAYMENT_PENDING order or cancel+recreate, create Order+Payment, create PayPal order, store ids; `captureOrderPayment` — capture with request id, `ORDER_ALREADY_CAPTURED` fallback, reference/amount/currency verification; `confirmCapturedPayment`; `markOrderPaid` idempotent transactional guards + cart clear; `markPaymentFailed`; `findOrderIdByPaypalOrderId`; `getOrderSummary`), `actions.ts` (`beginCheckoutAction` fails fast if PayPal unconfigured, validates, sets the signed cookie; `captureCheckoutAction`).
- `src/lib/paypal/webhook-handler.ts` — dedupe via `WebhookEvent`, dispatch `CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED` / `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED` / `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.DENIED`, terminal mismatches recorded as `rejected` (no retry) vs transient errors rethrown (route 5xx → PayPal retries). `src/app/api/webhooks/paypal/route.ts` — 503 unconfigured, 400 bad JSON/headers, 401 bad signature, 500 verification/processing failure.
- UI: `checkout/page.tsx` replaced the placeholder (empty/unavailable states, real cart summary, GBP total); `components/checkout/checkout-form.tsx` (delivery form, order summary, step 2 loads the PayPal JS SDK by script and renders Buttons whose `createOrder` returns the server-created order id and `onApprove` calls the capture action, then routes to success); `checkout/success/page.tsx` reads the signed cookie, shows paid/processing status and the snapshot.
- Tests (106 total, all passing; +35 for checkout): `checkout-service.test.ts` (integration + deterministic fake gateway: snapshot, begin/reuse/cancel, capture marks paid + clears cart, stable request id, amount/currency mismatch → PAYMENT_FAILED not paid, idempotent recapture, already-captured recovery), `paypal-webhook.test.ts` (approve/reject/dedupe/unknown), `orders-state.test.ts`, `checkout-schemas.test.ts`, `checkout-session.test.ts` (signed-cookie round-trip, tamper, expiry). Fake gateway in `tests/fake-paypal.ts`.
- Verification: `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `pnpm test` (106/106), production `next build` clean. Runtime (prod build vs `zitsy_store`): `/`, `/shop`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/checkout/success` 200; unknown product 404; `/checkout` with no cart → empty state; with a seeded real cart → form + summary + `£59.56`; `/checkout/success` with no cookie → not-found state; `POST /api/webhooks/paypal` unconfigured → 503. Temp cart removed after verification.
- **PENDING:** real PayPal Sandbox capture is **not** run — `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`/`PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`/`PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` are empty in `.env`. The capture path is covered by the deterministic fake gateway only. Set credentials to exercise Sandbox.
- **Hotfix (browser createOrder contract):** the PayPal JS SDK Buttons `createOrder` callback returned the legacy `{ orderID }` object, which current SDK versions reject with _"Expected an order id to be passed"_. It must resolve to the PayPal order id **string**. Extracted `createOrderCallback()` (`src/lib/checkout/paypal-buttons.ts`) so the contract is unit-tested, and the browser now receives the server-created PayPal id (never the internal Zitsy order id, never `{ orderID }`). Verified against real Sandbox: server `createOrder` returns a string id; the headless browser SDK (v5.0.580) called `GetCheckoutDetails` with that same id and logged no SDK error.
- Not in scope (deferred): Printify order creation/fulfillment, confirmation emails, shipping/tax engine, coupons.

### Phase 6 — Fulfillment: Printify order creation, production, status sync (DONE)
- **Schema.** New enum `FulfillmentStatus` (`PENDING, SUBMITTED, ON_HOLD, SENDING_TO_PRODUCTION, IN_PRODUCTION, PARTIALLY_FULFILLED, FULFILLED, CANCELLED, ACTION_REQUIRED, UNFULFILLABLE`). `Order` gains `fulfillmentStatus` (default `PENDING`), `printifySubmittedAt`, `printifySentToProductionAt`, `printifyFulfilledAt`, `printifyLastSyncedAt`, `fulfillmentError`, `fulfillmentAttempts` (existing `printifyOrderId @unique`, `printifyStatus`, `trackingCarrier/Number/Url` reused). Migration `20261007014652_add_fulfillment`. **Payment and fulfillment are separate state machines**: `Order.status` stays `PAID` after payment and is never overwritten by fulfillment; `isPaidOrderStatus` is still `PAID`-only.
- `src/lib/fulfillment/status.ts` — tolerant Printify status mapping (hyphen/underscore-tolerant; unknown → `ACTION_REQUIRED`), `mergeFulfillmentStatus` (forward-only, terminal-aware), `fulfillmentLabel`. `address.ts` — `splitRecipientName` + `buildPrintifyAddress` (rejects any country except GB/DE and any missing required field, deterministically). `errors.ts` — `FulfillmentError` (safe user messages) + `classifyPrintifyError` (401/403 operational, 429 retryable, 400/422 terminal, network/timeout/5xx retryable **and ambiguous**). `service.ts` — the engine below.
- **Creation (idempotent).** `createPrintifyOrderForZitsyOrder(orderId, gateway?)`: guard order exists → not already submitted (return existing) → `PAID` → `Payment.status === COMPLETED` → non-empty items → every line's variant still matches its product and `printifyVariantId`, quantity `1..99` → GB/DE address. Builds `PrintifyCreateOrderRequest` with `external_id = order.orderNumber`, `label = orderNumber`, server-derived `line_items`/`address_to`, and `send_shipping_notification = false`. Claims the result with `updateMany({ where: { id, printifyOrderId: null } })` so a concurrent creator can never overwrite the first; a lost claim is logged loudly for manual reconciliation but never silently duplicated.
- **Ambiguity & reconciliation.** A network/timeout/5xx failure on create persists `fulfillmentError = ambiguous_create:<detail>` and leaves the order `PAID` with no `printifyOrderId`. The next attempt reconciles first: list recent Printify orders and match `external_id`/`metadata.shop_order_label`; if found it adopts that order, otherwise it refuses to recreate. Guard failures on a paid order (unsupported country, bad address, invalid variant, missing payment) escalate `fulfillmentStatus` to `ACTION_REQUIRED`. Transient (429) failures leave the state retryable. `fulfillPaidOrder(orderId, gateway?)` is the crash-safe entry point used by checkout/webhooks: it serializes concurrent triggers per order in-process and never throws.
- **Production.** Sending to production is **never** part of the create call. `sendPrintifyOrderToProduction` calls `POST …/send_to_production.json` explicitly and is idempotent (`printifySentToProductionAt` guard). `fulfillPaidOrder` auto-calls it only when `PRINTIFY_AUTO_SEND_TO_PRODUCTION=true` (default `false`); the failure of that call is recorded but never un-submits the order.
- **Webhooks.** `processPrintifyWebhook` now handles `order:created|updated|sent-to-production|shipment:created|shipment:delivered` from both the modern `{ resource: { id, data } }` and legacy `{ data: { resource_id, … } }` shapes. Updates apply only fulfillment fields via `applyPrintifyOrderUpdate` (forward-only, sets tracking/`printifyFulfilledAt` on delivery); unknown order ids return `ignored`, duplicate `eventId`s are processed once, and errors rethrow so Printify retries.
- **Surfacing.** `OrderSummary` now carries `fulfillment` (status, raw `printifyStatus`, tracking, timestamps); `/checkout/success` shows the fulfillment label and a tracking link for paid orders.
- Tests (+41; 147 total): `tests/fulfillment.test.ts` (creation payload/address/idempotency/guards/ambiguous+reconcile/concurrency/auto-send/idempotent production/webhook status+tracking+legacy+dedupe+terminal-safety/payment-untouched/real-client-disabled), `tests/fulfillment-units.test.ts` (status mapping + address), `tests/fake-printify.ts` (deterministic gateway). `tests/setup.ts` mocks `getPrintifyClient()` so **no test can reach the real Printify API**. `tests/printify-client.test.ts` updated to the real create payload (removed the non-existent `send_to_production` field). `tests/catalog-sync.test.ts` updated: order events are handled now (unmappable → `ignored`).
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` (147/147), production `next build` clean. **Live Printify API** (GB, GBP, auto-send `false`): real order created from a live product/variant (`product_id`/`variant_id`/qty echoed back, `status: pending`), second call returned `already_submitted` with the same id (no duplicate), local order stayed `PAID` with `fulfillmentStatus: SUBMITTED`, and it was **never sent to production**. Finding: the single-order `GET` does **not** echo `external_id`, but the list endpoint returns `metadata.shop_order_label = <external_id>`, which is exactly what the ambiguity-reconciliation path (`listOrders`, ≤3 pages) matches on. The created Printify order remains `on-hold`/unproduced (`cancel.json` → `8501 Order status does not allow cancellation`); harmless but noted for cleanup.
- Not in scope (deferred): emails (Phase 7), auth/accounts (Phase 8), shipping/tax engine, order cancellation/refunds.

### Phase 7 — Commerce: pricing, FX, shipping, markets, catalog reconciliation (DONE)
- **Currency model.** Printify `variant.cost`, `variant.price` and shipping rates are in the shop's billing currency (USD here). Previously `variant.price` was stored verbatim as GBP — a silent USD-as-GBP bug. Now `PRINTIFY_COST_CURRENCY` (default `USD`) declares the source currency and the storefront derives its own GBP prices from the **fulfillment cost**, never from Printify's `price`. `STORE_FX_RATES` (e.g. `USD:GBP=0.754`) is a required, explicitly-configured rate table; `src/lib/fx.ts` (`parseFxRates`, `convertMinor`, `fxRate`, `FxRateError`) never assumes 1:1 and throws on a missing pair.
- **Pricing.** `src/lib/pricing.ts` — `toStoreMinor` (source minor → store currency minor), `charmPriceMinor` (round **up** to the next `.99`), `markupFloorMinor` (cost × (1 + markup)), `pricingFromCost` = cost → store currency → `STORE_MARKUP_PERCENT` (default `40`) floor → charm price. `STORE_MARKUP_PERCENT` is a **markup**, not a gross margin. Returns `null` when a variant has no usable cost. `ProductVariant.costMinor` added (migration `20261007065537_add_variant_cost_minor`) so the cost can be checked without recomputation. Printify's `variant.price`/`profit` are ignored.
- **Markets & address validation.** `src/lib/markets.ts` is the single source of shipping markets (GB, DE) with currency + national postcode patterns (`marketList`, `isSupportedCountry`, `countryName`, `validateShippingAddress`). Validation rejects unsupported countries, postcodes that don't match the market, and US-format addresses (US markers / full state names) mistakenly sent as GB/DE.
- **Shipping.** `src/lib/shipping.ts` — `calculateShipping(cart lines, destination, gateway?)` calls Printify `POST /shops/{shop_id}/orders/shipping.json`, requires the `standard` rate, converts it to store currency, caches identical quotes in-process (TTL 5 min), and fails safely (`shipping_unavailable`) instead of fabricating a number. The gateway is injected so tests never touch the network.
- **Checkout total authority.** `prepareCheckout(cartId, { destination, shippingGateway? })` performs the server-side revalidation/snapshot and adds shipping; `quoteCheckout` validates the address and returns an authoritative quote; `beginCheckout` derives the destination from the customer, recomputes shipping, and tells PayPal exactly that amount. `quoteCheckoutAction` powers a read-only estimate in `checkout-form.tsx` (debounced, shows "Calculating…" then the real amount) so the customer sees genuine shipping **before** payment. Shipping/tax rank: subtotal (server) + Printify standard shipping (server) = total (server); no client-supplied amount is trusted.
- **Profit safety.** `beginCheckout` calls `assertProfitable`, which uses the pure `src/lib/checkout/profitability.ts` `evaluateProfitability` over the whole order: `productRevenue + shippingRevenue − productionCost − expectedShippingCost − paymentFee − merchantFixedCost > 0` (all integer minor units). Product pricing and order-level profitability are deliberately separate concepts; shipping stays a separate customer charge but participates in the order check. `PAYMENT_FEE_PERCENT`/`PAYMENT_FEE_FIXED_MINOR` are conservative allowances (not contractual PayPal fees); `STORE_MIN_CONTRIBUTION_MINOR` (default `1`) and `STORE_MERCHANT_COST_MINOR` (default `0`) are documented knobs. A failed order is logged with safe structured figures and never reaches PayPal (`unprofitable_order`, generic customer message — no provider costs leaked). Prices are charm-rounded **up**, so the retail floor is never undershot. Merchant-side VAT is **not** modelled (no tax engine); see limitations.
- **Catalog webhooks.** `processPrintifyWebhook` product events now gate on `isFullProduct()`: only a payload that actually carries the full product shape (string `id` + non-empty `variants`) is upserted directly; a summary payload triggers `client.getProduct(id)` first. This prevents a summary event from wiping variants during `upsertProductFromApi`.
- **Scheduled reconciliation.** `GET /api/cron/catalog-sync` (`src/app/api/cron/catalog-sync/route.ts`) requires `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (503 when unset, 401 on mismatch), runs `syncCatalog`, and is wired to a daily Vercel cron in `vercel.json`. `syncCatalog` has an overlap guard: a full run within the last 30 minutes that has not finished causes the new run to be skipped (logged), so scheduled and manual syncs can't collide.
- Tests (+35; 182 total): `tests/fx.test.ts`, `tests/pricing.test.ts`, `tests/markets.test.ts`, `tests/shipping.test.ts` (currency/quote/unsupported/missing-rate/unreachable/cache), `tests/cron-catalog-sync.test.ts` (503/401/200/500), plus `checkout-service.test.ts` (quote + profit-safety) and new product-webhook authority cases in `catalog-sync.test.ts`. Catalog/cart fixtures updated to carry `cost` (the pricing source).
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` (182/182), production `next build` clean.
- Not in scope (deferred): emails/notifications, auth/accounts, tax, coupons, order cancellation/refunds, Printify publishing/republishing.

### Known limitations (Phase 7 commerce)
- **No tax engine.** No customer-facing VAT/tax is calculated. `STORE_MERCHANT_COST_MINOR` is the only merchant-side cost knob.
- **Printify VAT is outside the pre-order check.** Printify applies VAT on its post-order invoice; it cannot be derived reliably from the pre-order variant cost + shipping quote, so `evaluateProfitability` deliberately excludes it. Real example (mug ×4 to DE): the modelled expected contribution is **+£6.60**, while the observed Printify VAT of ≈$12.57 (≈£9.48) would make the all-in figure negative. Profitability therefore means "profitable under the modelled costs", not a guarantee of all-in margin. Raise `STORE_MERCHANT_COST_MINOR` where a known per-order overhead exists.
- **Payment fee is an allowance.** `PAYMENT_FEE_PERCENT` / `PAYMENT_FEE_FIXED_MINOR` are conservative assumptions, not PayPal's contractual fees.
- **Shipping quote cache** is keyed by country / postcode / city / region plus cart lines (address-line text does not change carrier rates for a locality). `beginCheckout` always re-quotes server-side, so a cached value can never become the charged amount.
- **Single currency.** GBP storefront only; no multi-currency checkout.

### Phase 8 — Transactional email, login-free order tracking, customer support (DONE)
- **Schema.** Migration `20261007184826_phase8_email_tracking`: `Order.trackingToken String? @unique`, `Order.deliveredAt DateTime?`, `EmailLog.dedupeKey String? @unique`.
- **Env.** `SUPPORT_EMAIL` (store inbox, why it is separate from `EMAIL_FROM`), `RESEND_API_URL` (test-only base-URL override for the SDK). `integrations.email` = `RESEND_API_KEY && EMAIL_FROM`; `integrations.support` = `RESEND_API_KEY && SUPPORT_EMAIL`. `emailConfig()` additionally refuses to send in production when `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is localhost, so email links can never be unopenable.
- **Send path.** `src/lib/email/`: `config.ts` (`emailConfig`, `absoluteUrl`, `contactUrl`), `client.ts` (`getEmailTransport` → official `resend` SDK, overridable for tests), `service.ts` (`sendTransactionalEmail` → `sent | duplicate | skipped | failed`, **never throws**: claims the `EmailLog` `dedupeKey` row, passes Resend `Idempotency-Key`, reclaims a stale `pending`, masks the recipient in logs), `errors.ts` (safe error text), `render.ts` + `templates/` (`EmailShell` layout, `EmailButton`/`SummaryRows`/`ItemList`/`DetailList` primitives, `@react-email/components` dropped for `@react-email/render` only), `order-notifications.ts` (`notifyOrderPaid/Submitted/Shipped/Delivered`, `runNotification` never throws).
- **Six emails.** order confirmed, order submitted to Printify, shipped (with carrier + tracking), delivered, admin new order (`SUPPORT_EMAIL`, internal markup), support received + support message (contact form). Keys: `order-confirmed|order-submitted|order-shipped|order-delivered|admin-new-order:<orderId>`, `support-message|support-received:<uuid>` — retried triggers never double-send.
- **Triggers (notification only, never business truth).** `markOrderPaid` → `notifyOrderPaid` (4 call sites in `checkout/service.ts`); `createPrintifyOrderForZitsyOrder` → `notifyOrderSubmitted`; `applyPrintifyOrderUpdate` → `notifyOrderShipped` / `notifyOrderDelivered` when the webhook actually advances state. A failed send is logged in `EmailLog` and cannot roll back payment, fail a PAID order or cancel a Printify order (`PRINTIFY_AUTO_SEND_TO_PRODUCTION` stays `false`).
- **Order tracking (no account).** `src/lib/orders/tracking.ts` (`createTrackingToken` = `randomBytes(24)` → base64url, `ensureTrackingToken`, `trackUrlForToken`, `buildOrderTrackingView`) + `tracking-actions.ts` (`lookupOrderAction`: Zod order number + email, one generic failure message for every miss, 10 lookups/min/IP). Pages `/(storefront)/track-order` (lookup form), `/track-order/[token]` (status, order number, items, address, totals, carrier/tracking + external link when present, no-login view) and `not-found` for a bad token. `/checkout/success` now links "Track your order".
- **Support.** `src/lib/contact/{schemas,service,actions}.ts` — Zod (`website` honeypot, message 10..2000 chars), 5 messages / 10 min / IP, delivers to `SUPPORT_EMAIL` with `Reply-To: customer` plus a receipt to the customer; `/contact` page + `contact-form.tsx` (client, `noValidate`, server errors in `role="alert"`); footer gains a **Help** column with **Track Order** and **Contact Us**.
- **Tests.** Unit **318/318 across 30 files** (`tests/fake-email.ts` transport injected through `tests/setup.ts`; new: `email-service` (dedupe/reclaim/skip/failed/redaction/no-secret-leak), `email-templates` (subjects, links, no localhost links, address block), `order-notifications` (4 triggers, idempotent, never throws), `tracking` (token entropy/uniqueness, lookup generic failure, view), `contact` (validation, honeypot, rate limit, both emails)). E2E **11/11** (`e2e/`): seeded test DB + local Resend HTTP stub (`e2e/resend-stub.ts` writes captured mail to `e2e/.resend-capture.json`) — tracking page/lookup failure/success/carrier details, contact validation + real submit captured by the stub, footer links, and the confirmation email's tracking link opened in the browser without logging in.
- **E2E gotchas recorded.** `playwright.config.ts` overrides `DATABASE_URL` (test DB) and `RESEND_API_URL` (stub) before workers spawn, so neither the app nor the tests can touch the dev DB or the real Resend API; Playwright transpiles imported `.tsx` with its **own** JSX runtime (`playwright/jsx-runtime`, objects `{__pw_type: 'jsx'}` that React cannot render), so every email template carries `/** @jsxImportSource react */` to keep server-side rendering inside test workers. `vitest.config.ts` excludes `e2e/**` so specs are not run by `pnpm test`.
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` (318/318), `pnpm build` (`/contact`, `/track-order`, `/track-order/[token]` routes present), `pnpm test:e2e` (11/11).
- Not in scope (deferred): auth/accounts, email queue/worker (sends are inline best-effort), ticket dashboard/CRM, marketing email of any kind, live Resend delivery (verified against the local stub — no real customer email was sent).

### Known limitations (Phase 8 email/tracking/support)
- **Rate limits are in-process memory** (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`): correct for the current single-instance deployment, not for multi-instance/serverless without a shared store.
- **No queue/retry worker.** A failed send is recorded in `EmailLog` as `failed`; there is no automatic re-send sweep (the same trigger re-fires safely only when the underlying event is re-processed).
- **Tracking link possession = read-only access** by design (no login). Tokens are random, revocable only by regenerating them, and never appear in list pages.
- **Live Resend sending was not exercised in this phase** — delivery is verified against a local HTTP stub that speaks the Resend API shape.

### Final production-readiness audit
- **Outcome: READY WITH REQUIRED PRE-LAUNCH ACTIONS.** No code blockers remain after this audit; the readiness blockers are environment/credential configuration described under *Required pre-launch actions* below.
- **Fixed in this audit:**
  - **Order reuse ignored address edits (HIGH).** `beginCheckout` reused an in-flight `PAYMENT_PENDING` order when email + total + cart snapshot matched. Flat-rate shipping makes two different GB addresses cost the same, so an address-only edit was silently shipped to the customer's previous address. The reuse predicate now compares the full contact + shipping address too (`recipientName, address1, address2, city, region, postalCode, country, phone`); any change cancels the old order and creates a new one.
  - **Paid order could sit unfulfilled with no retry (HIGH).** Fulfillment failures were recorded but nothing ever ran the idempotent `fulfillPaidOrder` again, and the customer-facing message promised an automatic retry that did not exist. Now (a) the already-paid early-return branches in `captureOrderPayment`/`confirmCapturedPayment` also retry fulfillment on every later capture/webhook event, and (b) a new scheduled sweep `/api/cron/fulfillment-retry` (hourly, `CRON_SECRET`-protected, timing-safe) re-runs `fulfillPaidOrder` for `PAID`/unsubmitted orders stuck on a transient `printify_unavailable` error, bounded by `fulfillmentAttempts < 10` (batch 20). Ambiguous creates and data errors are deliberately excluded (recreate would risk duplicates; retrying cannot fix data).
  - **Clean-checkout build failed (BLOCKER/deployment).** `src/generated/` is gitignored and nothing regenerated it, so a fresh install/deploy could not build. `package.json` now has `postinstall: prisma generate` and `build: prisma generate && next build`.
  - **No baseline security headers (MEDIUM).** `next.config.ts` now sets the header set in §9 (no CSP by design) and `Cache-Control: private, no-store` on `/checkout/success` and `/track-order/*`; `X-Powered-By` removed.
  - **JSON-LD `</script>` breakout (MEDIUM).** The product page's `application/ld+json` used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unescaped `JSON.stringify`; `<` is now escaped to `\u003c` so a catalog string cannot break out of the script element.
  - **Cron bearer comparison not timing-safe (LOW).** Both cron routes now share `src/lib/cron/auth.ts` (`verifyCronAuth`, length-checked `timingSafeEqual`).
- **Required pre-launch actions (environment/credentials in the deployment environment, not code):**
  1. `DATABASE_URL` → the production Postgres (`.env` currently points at `localhost`).
  2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` / `AUTH_URL` → the real production domain (dev uses `localhost`; a production build refuses localhost by design).
  3. `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=production` (currently `sandbox`) with the matching production `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`/`PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID` set to a **real-verified webhook** (currently empty ⇒ `/api/webhooks/paypal` 503s, fail closed).
  4. `PRINTIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` → the same secret configured at Printify for `product:created/updated/deleted/order:status` webhooks (currently empty ⇒ `/api/webhooks/printify` 503s, fail closed).
  5. `CRON_SECRET` → a random value (missing ⇒ catalog + fulfillment-retry crons 503).
  6. `EMAIL_FROM` / `SUPPORT_EMAIL` → a **Resend-verified** sender/domain (currently `zitsy.example` placeholders); any customer email to an unverified domain is a configuration 403 from Resend, not an app bug.
  7. Run `prisma migrate deploy` against production before turning traffic on (6 migrations).
  8. Vercel: configure all env vars for the Production environment; cron functions require a paid plan (Hobby cron limits may prevent hourly fulfillment retries).
- **Verification (§32):** `pnpm typecheck` ✓, `pnpm lint` ✓ (0/0), `pnpm test` **324/324 across 31 files**, `pnpm build` ✓ (16 routes, evaluated with `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://zitsy.example` per the localhost guard; a localhost `.env` intentionally fails a production build), `pnpm test:e2e` **11/11**. All unconfigured integration endpoints verified to fail closed (503) against the production build.

### Next phase
Phase 9 — auth/account. Phase 10 polish, Phase 11 verification.
